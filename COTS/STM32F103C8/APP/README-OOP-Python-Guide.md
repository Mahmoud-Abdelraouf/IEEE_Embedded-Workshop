## **Introduction**

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of "objects." In Python, OOP allows you to model real-world entities as objects in your code. Each object can contain data (attributes) and behaviors (methods), making your code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.

## **Key Concepts of OOP**

### 1. **Classes and Objects**

-   **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects instantiated from the class can have.
-   **Object**: An instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is created.

**Example**:

```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis familiaris"  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute
        self.age = age    # Instance attribute

    def description(self):
        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old"

my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)  # Creating an object
print(my_dog.description())  # Output: Buddy is 3 years old
```

### 2. **Attributes**

-   **Class Attributes**: Variables that are shared among all instances of a class.
-   **Instance Attributes**: Variables that are unique to each instance of a class.

**Example**:

```python
class Car:
    wheels = 4  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand  # Instance attribute
        self.model = model  # Instance attribute

my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
print(my_car.wheels)  # Output: 4
print(my_car.brand)   # Output: Toyota
```

### 3. **Methods**

-   **Instance Methods**: Functions that operate on an instance of a class. They can access and modify the object’s attributes.
-   **Class Methods**: Functions that operate on the class itself, rather than instances. They are marked with the `@classmethod` decorator.
-   **Static Methods**: Functions that neither modify object state nor class state. They are marked with the `@staticmethod` decorator.

**Example**:

```python
class Circle:
    pi = 3.14  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius  # Instance attribute

    def area(self):
        return self.pi * (self.radius ** 2)  # Instance method

    @classmethod
    def class_method_example(cls):
        return f"Class method accessed: {cls.pi}"

    @staticmethod
    def static_method_example():
        return "Static method accessed"

circle = Circle(5)
print(circle.area())  # Output: 78.5
print(Circle.class_method_example())  # Output: Class method accessed: 3.14
print(Circle.static_method_example())  # Output: Static method accessed
```

### 4. **Encapsulation**

Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a class, and restricting access to some of the object’s components. In Python, this is done using private attributes (prefixing with `__`).

**Example**:

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance):
        self.owner = owner
        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount <= self.__balance:
            self.__balance -= amount
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds")

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

account = BankAccount("John", 1000)
account.deposit(500)
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500
```

### 5. **Inheritance**

Inheritance allows one class (child class) to inherit the attributes and methods of another class (parent class), promoting code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.

**Example**:

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def move(self):
        print(f"{self.name} moves")

class Dog(Animal):  # Dog inherits from Animal
    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} barks")

my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
my_dog.move()  # Output: Buddy moves
my_dog.bark()  # Output: Buddy barks
```

### 6. **Polymorphism**

Polymorphism allows methods in different classes to have the same name but behave differently. This is often implemented via method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

**Example**:

```python
class Bird:
    def move(self):
        print("Bird flies")

class Penguin(Bird):
    def move(self):
        print("Penguin swims")

bird = Bird()
penguin = Penguin()

bird.move()    # Output: Bird flies
penguin.move()  # Output: Penguin swims
```

### 7. **Abstraction**

Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It can be achieved using abstract classes and methods in Python, which provide a blueprint for other classes.

**Example**:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

rect = Rectangle(10, 20)
print(rect.area())  # Output: 200
```

### 8. **Composition**

Composition is a design principle where a class is composed of one or more objects from other classes, rather than inheriting from them. This allows for a more flexible relationship between objects.

**Example**:

```python
class Engine:
    def start(self):
        print("Engine started")

class Car:
    def __init__(self, engine):
        self.engine = engine  # Car has an Engine

    def drive(self):
        self.engine.start()
        print("Car is driving")

engine = Engine()
my_car = Car(engine)
my_car.drive()  # Output: Engine started \n Car is driving
```

## **Calling Methods Within a Class Using `self`**

In Python, the `self` keyword is used to reference the current instance of the class. When one method in a class needs to call another method in the same class, `self` is used to do so. This ensures that the method is called on the specific instance of the class that is being used.

### Example 1: Simple Method Calling Another Method

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def description(self):
        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old"

    def speak(self, sound):
        return f"{self.name} says {sound}"

    def full_description(self):
        # Calling another method in the same class using self
        return f"{self.description()} and {self.speak('Woof!')}"

my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)
print(my_dog.full_description())  # Output: Buddy is 3 years old and Buddy says Woof!
```

### Example 2: Method Calling a Private Method

In Python, methods can also be made private (by prefixing their names with `__`). The `self` keyword is still used to call these private methods within the class.

```python
class Robot:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def start(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is starting...")
        self.__boot_systems()  # Calling the private method

    def __boot_systems(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is booting all systems...")

robot = Robot("R2-D2")
robot.start()
# Output:
# R2-D2 is starting...
# R2-D2 is booting all systems...
```

### Example 3: Method Calling Another Method with Arguments

Sometimes, a method might need to pass arguments to another method in the same class. `self` is used in the same way, ensuring that the method is called with the correct arguments.

```python
class Calculator:
    def add(self, x, y):
        return x

 + y

    def multiply_and_add(self, x, y, multiplier):
        result = self.add(x, y)  # Calling add method
        return result * multiplier

calc = Calculator()
print(calc.multiply_and_add(2, 3, 4))  # Output: 20
```

In this example, the `multiply_and_add` method calls the `add` method to get the sum of `x` and `y`, and then multiplies the result by the `multiplier`.

## **Advantages of OOP**

-   **Modularity**: OOP helps in dividing the program into smaller, manageable parts or modules.
-   **Reusability**: With inheritance, objects can be reused across programs.
-   **Maintainability**: Encapsulation allows for easy modification without affecting other parts of the code.
-   **Flexibility**: Polymorphism and composition provide flexibility in how classes and objects interact with each other.

## **Conclusion**

OOP in Python is a powerful tool that allows developers to create robust, maintainable, and reusable code. By understanding and applying the principles of classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, and composition, you can structure your Python programs in a way that is both efficient and scalable.
